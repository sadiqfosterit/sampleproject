  <h1>3.SCOPE  OF THE PROJECT</h1>
  <h2>3.1 SYSTEM LAYOUT:</h2>
  <p> 3.1.1  Playing Board Description: This game can be played in a N x n grid. As 3 x 3 is most popular so we will create 3 x 3 grid board. So, there are total 3 row and 3 column and 9 grids in our game board. The game can be played by two players. There are two options for players: Computer to Hunan and Human to Hunan. We will create Human to Human Tik Tok Toe game.</p>

  <p> 3.1.2  Rules of the Game: At the beginning of the game the 9 grids are empty. A player can choose between two symbols with his opponent, usual games use “X”and “O”. If first player choose “X” then the second player have to play with “O” and vice versa. First player will input into grid and remaining 8 are blank. Then second player turn. So second player also input his symbol and remaining 7 is blank and it will be continued. Each player has aim to create a straight line before his/her opponent win. Finally, there are three cases to finish the game.<br>
  1.  Player who win: Create a straight line before his/her opponent to win the game.<br>
  2.  Restricts the opponent: Restrict his opponent from creating a straight line first.<br>
  3.  None will win: When all grids are filled but no one create his straight line then game will tie.<br>
  So, in this way there are three results 1. First player wins 2. Second player wins and 3. No one will win the game is tie.





  If first player choose "X" the the second player have to play with "O" and vice versa.
The player who succeeded in placing three respective marks in a horizontal,vertical or diagonal row wins the game.
There are the tow intensions of this game is-
1.Create a straight line before his opponent to win the game.
2.Restrict his opponent from creating a straight line first.
In case logically no one can creat a straight line with with his own symbol,the game results a tie.
Hence there are only three possible results- a player wins,his opponent wins or it is a tie.
Rules of the game:<br>
1.The game is to be played between two players.<br>
2.one of the player chooces"X" and the other "O" to marks their respective cells.<br>
3.The game starts with one of the players and the game ends when one of the players has one whole row/column/diagonal 
         filled with his/her respective character("X" or "O").<br>
4.If no one wins then  the game is said to be draw.<br>
